# Test outbound Apex REST callout logic

Build tests for your Apex outbound service logic using the included stubs (ProjectCalloutServiceMock and ProjectCalloutServiceMockFailure) and callout test class (ProjectCalloutServiceTest) in the package. You must have 90% test coverage to pass this challenge and assert values to prove that your logic is working as expected.
